## Leave Recorder - NEST JS - Telegram Bot

This is a sample demo application I created while learning Nest JS. It is used to automate the process of recording leaves.

The bot listens to messages in a group and records leaves accordingly. This app is my first attempt on JS. Requires lots of improvements since this is my first :)

Other than NestJS, I have used mainly: 
- [chrono-node (for NLP of dates)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chrono-node)
- [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/index.html)
- [Node Telegram Bot Api](https://github.com/yagop/node-telegram-bot-api)

App is deployed on: https://protected-island-09159.herokuapp.com/.

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev
```
